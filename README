You can write a program in which language you like and you can use it
with anything interface.

* Simplest usage: 
(require 'anything-with-everything)
(add-anything-plugin "anything-my-cool-process" "my-cool-script.pl")
With this you can execute M-x `anything-my-cool-process'

* Requirement for your script:
Your script have to accept these two command line flag:
--init, --action
 $ yourscript --init=list # is executed to build up anything candidates.
You have to print candidates for anything.el. One candidate per line.
 $ yourscript --action=open # is required to execute anything action.
With selecting a candidate, anything-with-everything.el executes
 $ yourscript --action=open SELCTED_CANDIDATE

Example:
Download this file into ~/.emacs.d/anything/scripts/get-emacswiki-changes.pl
  https://gist.github.com/raw/732759/5e210890a98fc9b2de7463f8b3ec4c7d7d1b9d01/get-emacswiki-changes.pl
Try to execute this like
 $ perl get_emacswiki-changes.pl --init=list
If this works well, eval these elisp:

(require 'anything-with-everything)
(defun-anything-function-with-script "anything-emacswiki-changes" "get-emacswiki-changes.pl")
then `anything-emacswiki-changes' is defined so you can execute this like
M-x `anything-emacswiki-changes'
If you want to remove candidates cache buffer, do C-c C-u in anything buffer.


Advanced usage:
You can assign multiple anything sources like
(defun-anything-function-with-script "anything-with-multisource" "yourscript.pl"
  (("script-option1" . "First source") ("script-option2" . "Second Source")))

This means you get candiates with
 $ yourscript --init=script-optin1 # for first source
 $ yourscript --init=script-optin2 # for second source

An example for this usage is as follows:
Download this file into ~/.emacs.d/anything/scripts/get-hb-entries.pl
  https://gist.github.com/raw/731856/cf186c3da3d463aaec35c9d130fa79173780e79e/get-hb-entries.pl
and eval this
(defun-anything-function-with-script "anything-hb-entries" "get-hb-entries.pl"
  (("list" . "Hot Entries") ("my_entries" . "My Entries")))
And execute M-x `anything-hateb-entries'.
You can get candidates from multiple anything source.
